Write a program to print 1-100 prime numbers.

Use arrays: write a program to display images in your webpage every 10 sec - single image at a time. Hint use: SetInterval()

Use arrays: write a program to display quotes (one after the other in sequence) every 10 sec.  Hint use: SetInterval()

Once you implemented problem 3, now use a math object to display a random quote every 10 sec - instead of sequence.

Perform the following operations on an array - repeat these tasks on 2 more arrays:

concat() two arrays

join()

pop()

push()

reverse()

shift()

slice()

sort()

splice()

toString()

unshift()
set2
Write a program to return the length of a string "Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis". This question means return number of characters. (Hint: use .length).

For the above question 1, return the number of time the letter "o" appears.

Write a program to search for a particular term in a sentence (you can come up with a sentence) and if you find the term, replace with the term "javascript".

Find the number of times the string "not" appears in this sentence - 

" Javascript notation %^&* notes that structure rules and not context for nothing"

Now, for the above problem 4, create an array with texts before and after "not" occurrences.
set3
Write a program to convert Fahrenheit temperature to Celsius. Here are the things that needs to be implemented as a part of this question:

Ask the input from the user for Fahrenheit using a text field

As soon as the user types in the Fahrenheit number in the text field, the result should display immediately in the div below.

Hence, there should not be any submit button.

Hint: Use onkeyup event. Formula is :  C = (F - 32) * 5/9

Don't display the decimal values - but you should accept decimal values from the user

If the user enters any invalid values (strings) then you should make the input box border red and prompt user to enter correct values.

Write a program to have a small food menu for a restaurant and on click of button "SHOW ME TODAY's SPECIAL" - display today's special dish. Use the date() method to get current day of the week (Mon, tues, wed...).

Write a program to detect the current browser that the user is using.
